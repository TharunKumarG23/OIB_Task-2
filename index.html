            Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker.
            From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers
            including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar
            Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a
            1962 match.

        <p class="para2">
            These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the
            Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on
            to win in the predicted fifth round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13,
            1963, was Clay's toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders
            respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones' home turf at New York's Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered
            Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown
            into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay
            he (Liston) might get locked up for murder. The fight was later named "Fight of the Year" by The Ring
            magazine.

            Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. (/ˈkæʃəs/ KASH-əss) was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He
            had
            one brother. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., who had a sister and four
            brothers and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch
            abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay's father's paternal grandparents
            were
            John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay's sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar.He was
            a
            descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with Irish and
            English family heritage. Ali's maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, County
            Clare, Ireland. DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Ali was
            a
            descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of
            a
            freed man for the Emancipation Memorial, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot's book,
            The
            Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom. Like Ali, Alexander fought for his freedom.

            Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress
            Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad, who was to become Ali's long-time manager, and asked her to marry him after
            their first date. They married approximately one month later on August 14, 1964. They quarreled over
            Sonji's refusal to join the Nation Of Islam. According to Ali, "She wouldn't do what she was supposed
            to do. She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn't look
            right." The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966. Just before the divorce was
            finalized, Ali sent Sonji a note: "You traded heaven for hell, baby." Ali's brother Rahman said that
            she was Ali's only true love and the Nation of Islam made Ali divorce her and Ali never got over it.

        <p class="para5">
            On August 17, 1967, Ali married Belinda Boyd. In an interview with NBC 6, Boyd recounted meeting Ali when
            she was 10 years old at her hometown mosque. "He said, 'Listen here little girl. This is my name. Imma be
            famous. You need to keep that 'cause it's gone be worth a lot of money,'" Boyd said, mimicking Ali. "You'll
            never be famous with that name. And, I walked away," Boyd said. Born into a Chicago family that had
            converted to the Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called
            Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: author and rapper Maryum "May May" (born
            1968); twins Jamillah and Rasheda (born 1970); and Muhammad Ali Jr. (born 1972). Rasheda married Robert
            Walsh and has two sons: Biaggio Ali, (born 1998), and Nico Ali (born 2000), who is a professional
            boxer.

            By the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed an estimated 200,000 hits.
            In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's syndrome, which sometimes results from head trauma from violent
            physical activities such as boxing. Ali still remained active during this time, later
            participating as a guest referee at WrestleMania I.

        <p class="para5">
            Ali was known for being a humanitarian and philanthropist. He focused on practicing his
            Islamic duty of charity and good deeds, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people
            of all religious backgrounds. It is estimated that Ali helped to feed more than 22 million people afflicted
            by hunger across the world. Early in his career, one of his main focuses was youth education. He spoke
            at several historically black colleges and universities about the importance of education, and became the
            largest single black donor to the United Negro College Fund in 1967 by way of a $10,000 donation ($78,000 in
            2020 USD). In late 1966, he also pledged to donate a total of $100,000 to the UNCF (specifically promising
            to donate much of the proceeds of his title defense against Cleveland Williams), and paid $4,500 per closed
            circuit installation at six HBCUs so they could watch his fights.

            Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though his
            condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from
            septic shock.

        </p>
        <p class="para5">
            Following Ali's death, he was the number-one trending topic on Twitter for over 12 hours and on Facebook for
            several days. BET played their documentary Muhammad Ali: Made In Miami. ESPN played four hours of non-stop
            commercial-free coverage of Ali. News networks, such as ABC News, BBC, CNN, and Fox News, also covered him
            extensively.

            He was mourned globally, and a family spokesman said the family "certainly believes that Muhammad was a
            citizen of the world ... and they know that the world grieves with him."[298] Politicians such as Barack
            Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to Ali. Ali also
            received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather,
            Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated,
            "Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one hometown.
